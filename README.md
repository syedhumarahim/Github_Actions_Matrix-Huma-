# Pandas Descriptive Statistics Script
This is the second Assignment for Data Engineering on Pandas descriptive statistics.

# Heart Attack Risk Analysis 
## Project Aim
The aim of this project is to analyze the risk of heart attacks across different demographics and various lifestyle and health factors using data visualization techniques and statistical analysis. This analysis seeks to uncover patterns and trends that can help in predicting heart attack risks.

## Project Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:

## Setup and Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DE_ASSIGN2_HUMA.git
cd DE_ASSIGN2_HUMA
```

Install dependencies:

`make install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Functions Description
- generate_and_save_plots(df, save_dir): Generates and saves various plots to visualize the heart attack risk data.
- create_summary_table(df): Creates a table of summary statistics for the given DataFrame.
- create_pdf_report(df, image_dir, output_pdf): Generates a comprehensive PDF report with all the plots and summaries.

## Data
This dataset provides an array of risk factors associated with heart attacks.

Columns Overview:

- Patient ID: Unique identifier for each patient. (Categorical)
- Age: Patient's age in years. (Numeric)
- Sex: Patient's gender. (Categorical)
- Cholesterol: Measured cholesterol levels. (Numeric)
- Blood Pressure: Recorded blood pressure levels. (Numeric)
- Heart Rate: Measured heart rate. (Numeric)
- Diabetes: Indicates whether the patient has diabetes (Yes/No). (Categorical)
- Family History: Indicates a family history of heart disease (Yes/No). (Categorical)
- Smoking: Smoking status of the patient. (Categorical)
- Obesity: Indicates obesity status. (Categorical)
- Alcohol Consumption: Alcohol consumption patterns. (Categorical)
- Exercise Hours Per Week: Number of hours the patient exercises per week. (Numeric)
- Diet: Type of diet the patient follows. (Categorical)
- Previous Heart Problems: Indicates previous heart-related issues (Yes/No). (Categorical)
- Medication Use: Usage of prescribed medication (Yes/No). (Categorical)
- Stress Level: Assessed level of stress. (Numeric)
- Sedentary Hours Per Day: Average number of sedentary hours per day. (Numeric)
- Income: Annual income bracket. (Categorical)
- BMI: Body Mass Index. (Numeric)
- Triglycerides: Level of triglycerides in the blood. (Numeric)
- Physical Activity Days Per Week: Days per week the patient engages in physical activity. (Numeric)
- Sleep Hours Per Day: Average number of hours the patient sleeps per day. (Numeric)
- Country: The patient's country of residence. (Categorical)
- Continent: The continent on which the patient lives. (Categorical)
- Hemisphere: Hemisphere of the patient's location. (Categorical)
- Heart Attack Risk: Indicates if the patient is at risk of a heart attack (0 = No, 1 = Yes). (Categorical)
- Systolic_BP: Systolic blood pressure reading. (Numeric)
- Diastolic_BP: Diastolic blood pressure reading. (Numeric)

## Top Insights:
After thorough analysis, key insights include:

- Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, and BMI: Higher levels of cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and BMI are associated with increased heart attack risk, particularly noticeable in females.
- Age Distribution: Heart attack risk is not confined to older age groups; there are notable risks in individuals under 30 and over 60, indicating potential genetic and lifestyle influences.
- Income and Gender: While income variations do not significantly impact heart attack risk in males, higher income in females correlates with slightly increased risk, hinting at underlying socioeconomic factors.
- Lifestyle Factors: Minor variances in physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep hours suggest these factors alone are not major determinants of heart attack risk, highlighting the complexity of risk factors involved.
- Recommendations: Efforts to prevent heart attacks should prioritize the management of modifiable risk factors such as cholesterol and blood pressure, tailored to individuals across all age groups and genders, emphasizing universal cardiovascular health strategies.
